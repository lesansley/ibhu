/**
The only gin designed by the African elephant from foraged botanicals, uncover the true taste of Africa in every glass.
The gin is smooth, complex with earthy flavours and so good all you need is a glass and ice.

This is an exclusive gin for the person who loves the spirit of Africa – the freedom, the sunsets, the textures and the flavours of the African bush.
Indlovu original gin is made using multiple flavouring runs.
The essential ingredients in Indlovu gin are derived from elephant dung that is washed and dried. The extracted botanicals are then infused into the gin, which provides unique African flavours.

PROVENANCE
With help from the elephants of Botlierskop Game Reserve, we produced our first batch of Africa’s Original Elephant Dung Gin – Indlovu Gin.
Being able to trace provenance is important because Indlovu gin will have vintages (similar to wine). Depending on the locale where and season during which the dung is collected the botanicals will vary, which will infuse different flavours.
The provenance of each bottle of our gin can be traced by the lot number, which is made up of 2 parts.
Lot No.:	34.03S 22.14E
260618
The first part is the coordinates of the game reserve where the dung was collected e.g. 34.03S 22.14E which is Botlierskop Game Reserve and the second is the date on which the dung collected e.g. 260618, which is 2018-06-26.
