Why the botanicals from the dung ? Does the digestive process contribute anything to the taste of the gin ? Could you not rather have sourced the fresh botanicals instead of getting it from the dung ?
The original idea for elephant dung gin came from marrying the love of Africa and its wildlife with the love of gin. We are both scientists—and therefore inclined towards novel ideas and problem solving—so when Paula had the idea we really wanted to see whether it would actually be possible. The more we explored the concept the more it opened up and the more excited we became. It is possible that the digestive process does contribute to the flavouring (similar to the elephant dung coffee) but it would be difficult to say conclusively. However, what we are very excited about, and what we would not achieve if we sourced the fresh botanicals, is Indlovu gin vintages. Because botanicals available for the elephants to forage are going to change depending on the season, climate and location we expect very distinct flavours depending on when and where the elephant dung used in the gin is harvested. The provenance of each run it captured in its Lot No. Currently 34S22E43277. To break this down, 34S22E are the coordinates of the reserve where the elephants’ dung was collected (Botlierskop Private Game Reserve) and 43277 is the date (in days from 1899-12-31) that the dung was collected. Regarding the botanicals, aside from the usual suspects (Juniper, Angelica, Orris Root, Coriander and citrus) the botanicals include Buccu (Agathosma crenulata), Acacia (Acacia mearnsii), Guarii (Euclea undulata) and Erica (Erica coccinea) (which are the elephants’ favourite foods).
Another very inspiring aspect of using elephant dung is our tie-in with Africa Foundation. This creates an amazing virtuous circle by which the elephants ‘contribute’ to funding conservation projects that impact the welfare of the elephants.

How is the dung cleaned?
We take the cleansing process very seriously. There are six steps involved in the preparation process:

COLLECTING
WASHING
STERILISING
RINSING
DRYING
STORING
How do you suggest Indlovu gin is enjoyed?
Our gin can be enjoyed in the usual G&T manner but we think that the taste and mouth texture of the gin lends itself towards a cognac-type experience. The earthy flavours complement coffee and dark chocolate. So a neat gin sipped with espresso and enjoyed with dark after-dinner chocolate perfectly rounds off a meal. Of course, the gin can be enjoyed in the more traditional sense of mixers at sundown. But again here we would be hesitant to recommend a flavoured or sugary tonic as this detracts from the rounded flavour of the gin.

Where is the gin produced?
The creation of Indlovu Gin from conception to consumption has been under the tutelage of the internationally renowned craft gin master—Roger Jorgensen—in Stellenbosch.

Are you planning more gins under the Ibhu brand?
We most certainly are. Watch this space.

Are you planning to export?
We most certainly are and are in the process of exploring overseas opportunities. Please contact us if you know of any.
